Here we will see that for every smartphone, one thing will be exactly the same which is the format of presentation. Every phone will be presented in the exact same way, like there will be a specific space and dimension for image, specific for name, specific for specifications etc. So for implementing the repetition of the format where total no. of Samsung smartphones is specified, For loop will be used.\n",
