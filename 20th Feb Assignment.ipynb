Once the redirect() function is called, Flask will send a response to the client with an HTTP status code of 302 (Found) and a Location header set to the URL passed to the redirect() function.

    "Templates allow Flask to generate dynamic HTML pages that can change based on different data or user inputs. By using templates, Flask applications can be more maintainable and easier to develop, as the HTML code is separated from the application logic, and changes to the presentation can be made without affecting the application logic.\n",
