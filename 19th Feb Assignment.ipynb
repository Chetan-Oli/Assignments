    "\n",
    "Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, allowing developers to quickly build web applications with minimal overhead. <br>\n",
    "Flask follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, which separates the application into three components: the model, which represents the data and business logic; the view, which displays the data to the user; and the controller, which handles user input and manages communication between the model and view.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the advantages of using Flask include:\n",
    "1. Lightweight and flexible: <br>\n",
    "Flask is a lightweight framework that provides only the essential features needed for building web applications. This makes it easy to use and highly customizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Easy to learn: <br>\n",
    "Flask is designed to be easy to learn, with a simple and intuitive API that is easy to understand and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Extensible: <br>\n",
    "Flask can be easily extended with third-party libraries and tools, allowing developers to add additional functionality to their applications as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Built-in development server: <br>\n",
    "Flask includes a built-in development server that makes it easy to test and debug applications during development.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Large and active community: <br>\n",
    "Flask has a large and active community of developers who contribute to the framework and provide support and resources for other developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Integration with other tools: <br>\n",
    "Flask integrates easily with other tools and technologies commonly used in web development, such as databases, templating engines, and authentication frameworks."
